Marked enemies have significantly increased stats. (Rarity of the dropped item increases with stacks)." Additionally, it has clearer mark VFX.
    * Reworked Needles: "Non-critical strikes add +1% critical chance against the struck enemy. Additional critical chance is cleared after 1 (+1 per stack) critical strikes against them."
    * Reworked Coffee Bag: "Using interactables increases movement speed by 21% and attack speed by 22.5% for up to 15 (+15 per stack) seconds."
    * Reworked Pressurized Cannister: "Grants an upward boost upon activating, and grants a temporary additional jump until landing."
    * Adjusted Detritive Trematode - The debuff no longer expires, but the low health threshold was lowered to 25% for consistency with other "low health" items.
    * Adjusted Droid Head - Spawned drones are now more aggressive and should be less likely to spawn clipping into the ground.
    * Adjusted MIDAS - When given to an equipment drone, the drone now splits the gold it would recieve amongst all players.
    * Adjusted Greater Warbanner - No longer directly gives CDR, but instead makes cooldowns tick faster.

    * Updated Russian translation.
    * Added Ukranian translation.
* Items & Equipment
    * Items can now individually be enabled / disabled via config file. Note that equipment remain unaffected by this change at the moment.
    * Reworked Needles: "Hitting enemies has a 6% chance to prick them, converting all incoming damage to critical hits for 2 seconds (+2s per stack)." Does this feel more balanced? Should the pricked debuff still allow debuffs to critically hit?
    * Reworked Coffee Bag: "Using interactables increases movement speed by 21% (+21% per stack) and attack speed by 22.5% (+22.5% per stack) for 15 seconds."
    * Reworked X-4 Stimulant: "Reduces secondary skill cooldown by 10% (+10% per stack) and increases base health regen by +2 hp/s (+1 hp/s per stack) for 3 seconds on secondary use." Should probably one have one stacking condition - which?
    * Disabled Diary. Item suffers a constant identity crisis without ever feeling impactful. Have been talks of reworks internally, but nothing finalized yet.

    * Greater Warbanner no longer automatically despawns after 90 seconds. Fixed a major bug causing massive lag when switching stages related to the equipment.

    * Capped Swift Skateboard's buff stacks again.
    * Fixed X4's cooldown reduction.

    * Adds Relic of Termination, with temp VFX.
    * Reworked Coffee Bag.
    * Added a new icon for Executioner's alt primary by goodguy#3899. Thank you!
    * Droid Head will no longer spawn void infestors.
    * Fixed VFX for Relic of Force.
    * Nkota's Heritage can no longer drop itself.
    * Losing Baby's Toys no longer reduces your level - it now adds the levels gained from it back to your current level. This readding does not proc Nkota's Heritage.
    * On skills with multiple base stocks, X4 will only proc once (+1 per additional stock (ex backup mag)) per recharge interval. This primarily normalizes the healing gained form skills like Nemmando's Single Tap and Mul-T's Power Mode.
    * X4 heals on firing a sniper shot on Railgunner, like backup mag, rather than healing you on scoping in for their default secondary. No change to the alt secondary.
    * Added all DLC0 item displays for Executioner.
    * Bottled Chaos can no longer activate Back Thruster, MIDAS, and Pressurized Canister.
    * Executioner should no longer rarely become a lantern.
    * Portable Reactor can appear on enemies again (with fourthed duration) because it's hilarious. Also reduces turret / ally invulnerability duration to one fourth.
    * Enemies can no longer recieve Armed Backpack. Additionally, lowered the minimum chance for the item to activate as it was overpreforming.
    * Slightly increased the speed at which Watch Metronome gains charges.
    * Increased the cooldown of MIDAS from 30s to 75s.
    * Swift Skateboard no longer breaks Bandit's backstabs.
    * Swift Skateboard should no longer only buff the host whilst destroying the ears of the clients.
    * Fixed config name for Low Quality Speakers.
    * Fixed the icon for Back Thruster's buff.
    * Fixed up the logbook. Items are now positioned better and have cleaner descriptions.

### 0.3.41-43Î²
* We do not speak about these updates.

### 0.3.40Î²
* Continued fixes and adjustments.
    * M.I.D.A.S gold gain is now scaled based on difficulty (and thus, player count). This largely essentially only comes in to play fairly late into runs.
    * Nkota's Heritage shouldn't cause NREs as much. 
    * Cleaned up some X4 and Nkotas debug statements. 
    * Nemmando's animations no longer break after getting frozen while charging his alternate special.
    * Nemmando's alt special no longer lies about scaling the number of hits with attack speed. It and the scepter variant actually scale now. 
    * Nemmando no longer gains additional stacks of certain items. Additionally, more of his item displays are functional.
    * Relic of Force now only procs on hits with a proc coefficent and the additional hits have half the proc coefficient of the hit that caused them. Still might be a bit strong. 
    * Droid Head base duration increased from 15s -> 20s, and gains an additional 5s lifetime per stack. Additionally, they should hopefully fire at enemies a bit more consistently. 
    * Updated logbook descriptions for Armed Backpack, Fork, and Jet Boots to be more clear and accurate. Made X4's logbook entry actually readable, and cleaned up text coloring for Diary.
    * AIs can no longer receive Portable Reactor, as it was hilariously unfair.
    * Jet Boots no longer deal self damage with Artifact of Chaos enabled. 

### 0.3.39Î²
* Minor Fixes/Adjustments.
    * X4 no longer allows enemies to heal on using their secondary skills when they don't have it.
    * Slightly reduced the height of Executioner's special. It's a bit more reasonable now.
    * Buffed Armed Backpack's damage from 100% to 400%. It's an on damage proccing item that only hits one enemy, so it having a large payoff is justified.
    * Actually properly adds Nemmando's Scepter skills. Executioner will come later!
    * Prevents Blizzards from completely blinding you. The snow is lighter now.

### 0.3.38Î²
* Updated to Survivors of the Void & MSU 1.0.1. 
    * This update has notable balance changes! Please delete your configs. 
	* Was a long time coming, with of course more to come.
    * The dev team has nearly entirely changed hands. Yay!

* General:
	* Fixed bugs caused by various interactions between new items / survivors. (ex. Molten coin works with ignition tank.)
	* Disabled items that were replaced by SOTV items, those being Coffee Bag, Dormant Fungus, and Erratic Gadget. These items may get reworks some time down the line. 
	* Adjusted some descriptions for items and abilities to be more clear / accurate. 
    * Added configs for more items that previously lacked them.

* Survivors:
    * <b>Executioner: </b>
    * Adjusted base stats to be more in line with normal survivors. 

	* <b>Nemesis Commando: </b>
    * Adjusted base stats to be more in line with a melee survivors.
	* Reduced damage for Submission, his default special, from 48x60% to 24x70%.
	* Added a new keyword - Rend. Pistol skills have this keyword, which makes them deal more damage to enemies with gouge applied.
	* Readded Ancient Scepter skills.

* Items 
	* <b>Tier 1: </b>
	* Armed Backpack - reworked. Chance to fire a missile on taking damage. 
	* Detritive Trematode - Low health threshold normalized from 40% -> 25%, and increased DoT damage to compensate 
	* Diary - reworked. Gain bonus EXP upon killing a boss enemy. 
	* Fork - Adjusted to be +2 base damage. Ends up being largely the same for most survivors, with only Mul-T getting a slight buff and Acrid getting a slight nerf. Additionally makes the item way less scary when enemies get it.
	* Malice - Only procs from survivor attacks. Damage reduced from 55% -> 35% total damage. Maintains damage through the chain, rather than decaying per jump.
	* Needles - Required procs for full crits reduced from 5 -> 2.

	* <b>Tier 2: </b>

	* Jet Boots - Replaced stunning in the description with description. It never stunned. 
	* Low Quality Speaker - has a model and new icon.

	* <b>Tier 3: </b>
	* Baby's Toys - Now actually reduces level by 3, keeping the stats.
	* Nkota's Heritage - Stacking now gives multiple items per level up rather than increasing drooped item rarity. 
	* Portable Reactor - has a model and icon.

	* <b>Lunar: </b>

    * Added new Sprint animation
    * Doubled turning radius to be in-line with Vanilla survivors
* Items
    * All: Rewrote many descriptions to match Vanilla wording and phrasing better
    * A Lot: Modified internally to use RecalculateStatsAPI, which means better stat stacking and less bugs.
    * Armed Backpack: Added
    * Back Thruster: Slight rework - now functions like Metroid's Speed Booster when activated, accelerating the user when running in a straight line (*Would this feel better if you could 'run over' enemies for damage? Like a Bighorn Bison?*)

    * Broken Blood Tester: Now uses flat values instead of whatever nonsense was going on before
    * Dormant Fungus: Reduced healing to not heal for 100% of health on proc

    * KNOWN ISSUE: Drop Pods dont have proper tokens
* Events
    * Nemesis Invasion: Nemesis survivors are now given inventories when spawning
    * KNOWN ISSUE: Event rates might be messed up still|
* Other

    * Language Files: Reformatted internally, let us know if issues arise as a result of this
    * Bugfix: Void cells should now always drop a reward
    * KNOWN ISSUE: MUL-T's Grand Mastery lacks emissions and tokens.

### 0.3.31Î²
(*I don't think this is appropriate for a full on dev log, but right now current focus is on fixing up content to reach version parity with Stable + push ThunderKit build to there. After that, we'll be looking at future content, including Cyborg and Ethereal Teleporters. For now, feedback is CRUCIAL - this is intended as a 'final test' for a lot of features, and specific things still need to be fixed that are skimmed over just to get this out ASAP. Things generally should be working more than before, but some things are still messed up. Be as critical of anything in the mod that seems off as you can.*)
* General
    * Title screen is now a bit less purple and a bit more Risk of Rain 2
    * KNOWN ISSUE: It's a long standing one, but it's on my to-fix list: MUL-T Grandmastery uses incorrect material.
    * KNOWN ISSUE: Unlocks are broken.
    * KNOWN ISSUE: Hottest Sauce, Jet Boots, and Stirring Soul have missing or broken visual effects.
    * KNOWN ISSUE: When Canticum Vitae ends it doesnt resume the original stage's song.
* Events
    * Significantly lowered intensity of Storm visuals
    * Enemies now receive a unique buff icon while storms are active to help signify that storms buff them
    * Slightly tweaked storm spawn rates, should now be less common. (*How do storm spawn rates feel? Too common? Too rare? Please test on multiple difficulties, and respect that the game is designed to be played on Rainstorm - though feedback for all is crucial.*)
    * Removed regular storms from Sky Meadow in favor of 100% Purple Rain
    * Nemesis Invasion: Removed from Commencement spawn pool (*This was a weird fix that may have broken things. Let me know if you see more than one Nemmando during your run. Also, the Void Event is being dropped entirely until we get a better look at the DLC. Until then, I may try to merge the old visuals into this if there's interest.*)
* Executioner
    * Fear: Updated buff icon
    * Crowd Dispersion: Lowered speed multiplier from 3.0 to 2.0, as it was pre-ThunderKit - this should make it more controllable
    * Supercharged: Updated buff icon

    * Fixed materials of all skins to match pre-ThunderKit
    * Gouge: Now refreshes duration of existing stacks when applied, again
    * Distant Gash: Now properly applies gouge
    * Added IDRS for all the Vanilla Items & Equipments.
    * (This just leaves his animator as an outlying issue.)*
* Items
(Developer Note: *You should probably delete your old config.*)
    * Detritive Trematode: Changed stacking behavior to directly increase damage rather than increase debuff duration
    * Detritive Trematode: Buffed movement speed reduction (10% -> 20%)
    * Dormant Fungus: Fixed scaling being 1/100th as good as it should've been. Oops

    * Dormant Fungus: Rebalance healing amounts (2% + 0.5% per stack -> 1% + 1% per stack) (*This was done as per suggestion of Moffein, as most Common items tend to scale linearally like this. This item is currently a candidate for a slight rework with the announcement of Weeping Fungus. Stay tuned.*)
    * Fork: Changed behavior to Starstorm 1's. The days of overpowered fork are no more! (+7% TOTAL damage -> +25% BASE damage, without levelups *This is probably a sad change but I think it's for the best.*)
    * Green Chocolate: Updated buff icon
    * Greater Warbanner: (*Would people prefer this item if you could place more than one at a time, but they disappeared after a duration? Or is it fine it is?*) 
    * Hunter's Sigil: Updated buff icon
    * Malice: Temporarily disabled (*Previous version of this item was breaking the game. Will have finished for final release.*)
