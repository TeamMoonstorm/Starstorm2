* **Executioner**  - An aggressive, versatile survivor with an arsenal made for picking off targets and chaining kills. His powerful Ion Manipulators gain charges with every kill.

* **Chirr** - A whimsical creature of Petrichor V, with a variety of abilities that give her a unique control over the battlefield. She supports her friends with potent buffs and heals.

* **???** - Survivors of unknown origin, familiar yet unfamiliar. Under the right conditions, you may meet them on the Planet, but they certainly won't be on your side.
