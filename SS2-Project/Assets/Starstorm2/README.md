**Starstorm 2** is a work-in-progress sequel to the Risk of Rain 1 mod "Starstorm". It currently features four new survivors, three new monsters, over 20 new items and equipment, and numerous new challenges to shake up your runs. In-depth information can be found on our [Wiki](https://starstorm2.wiki.gg/wiki/Starstorm_2_Wiki).

![New Survivors...](https://github.com/swuff-star/Starstorm2/blob/main/SS2-Project/Assets/Starstorm2/ReadmeAssets/ss2survivorpromo.gif?raw=true)

* **Executioner**  - An aggressive, versatile survivor with an arsenal made for picking off targets and chaining kills. His powerful Ion Manipulators gain charges with every kill.

* **Chirr** - A whimsical creature of Petrichor V, with a variety of abilities that give her a unique control over the battlefield. She supports her friends with potent buffs and heals.

* **???** - Survivors of unknown origin, familiar yet unfamiliar. Under the right conditions, you may meet them on the Planet, but they certainly won't be on your side.

![New Items...](https://github.com/swuff-star/Starstorm2/blob/main/SS2-Project/Assets/Starstorm2/ReadmeAssets/ss2itemspromo.gif?raw=true)

* **New Items & Equipment** - A plethora of new items and equipment to support new and existing playstyles. Watch your six with an Armed Backpack, rush through teleporter events with a Field Accelerator, all while keeping on the move with a Swift Skateboard - and more!

* **New Interactables** - New drones, paired with the Refabricator, come in handy to assist you while you fight for survival.

![New Challenges...](https://github.com/swuff-star/Starstorm2/blob/main/SS2-Project/Assets/Starstorm2/ReadmeAssets/ss2challengepromo.gif?raw=true)

* **Events** - Between severe weather, magical buildups, and mysterious invaders, learn to expect the unexpected as forces both natural and supernatural interfere with your runs.

* **New Monsters** - New species of the Planet have come out to put a stop to your invasion of their home.

* **Typhoon** - The Planet grows restless, with fearsome events and monsters coming in greater numbers than ever before. Unlock new skins for survivors* by proving yourself in this new challenge exceeding even Monsoon!
	 *currently includes Commando, Huntress, MUL-T, Acrid, Captain, Executioner, and Commando's Vestige.

* Known Issues
    * Man o War causes NRE spam, we've made a temporary dependenncy on MiscFixes mod by score until we can resolve the issue ourselves. Thank you score for the fix!
    * Elite events are currently disabled.
    * Artifact codes are not placed in world, and can instead be found on the wiki. (For now)
    * NOTE: Chirr players are advised to download [EnemyImportance](https://thunderstore.io/package/pseudopulse/EnemyImportance/) due to a known enemy sliding bug caused by how SOTS changes enemy collision and Chirr's grab. This mod also impacts performance so it isnt a requirement, but is recommended if you want the best Chirr experience
