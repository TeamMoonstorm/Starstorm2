**Starstorm 2** is a work-in-progress adaptation of the Risk of Rain 1 mod "Starstorm". It currently features two new survivors, over 20 new items and equipment, and numerous new challenges to shake up your runs.

![New Survivors...](https://github.com/swuff-star/Starstorm2/blob/main/SS2-Project/Assets/Starstorm2/ReadmeAssets/ss2survivorpromo.gif?raw=true)

* **Executioner**  - An aggressive, versatile survivor with an arsenal made for picking off targets and chaining kills. His powerful Ion Manipulators gain charges with every kill.

* **???** - A survivor of unknown origin, familiar yet unfamiliar. Under the right conditions, you may meet him on the Planet, but he certainly won't be on your side.

![New Items...](https://github.com/swuff-star/Starstorm2/blob/main/SS2-Project/Assets/Starstorm2/ReadmeAssets/ss2itemspromo.gif?raw=true)

* **New Items & Equipment** - A plethora of new items and equipment to support new and existing playstyles. Watch your six with an Armed Backpack, rush through teleporter events with a Field Accelerator, all while keeping on the move with a Swift Skateboard - and more! 

![New Challenges...](https://github.com/swuff-star/Starstorm2/blob/main/SS2-Project/Assets/Starstorm2/ReadmeAssets/ss2challengepromo.gif?raw=true)

* **Events** - Between severe weather, magical buildups, and mysterious invaders, learn to expect the unexpected as forces both natural and supernatural interfere with your runs.

* **Typhoon** - The Planet grows restless, with fearsome events and monsters coming in greater numbers than ever before. Unlock new skins for survivors* by proving yourself in this new challenge exceeding even Monsoon!
	 *currently includes Commando, MUL-T, Acrid, Captain, and Commando's Vestige.
	 
* **Artifact of Cognation** - A new, unlockable artifact to shape up your runs.

    * Fixed a bug with how Nemesis Commando checks to reload after Single Tap's stock count changes.
* Items
    * All items and equipment have better positioning in the logbook.

    * Adjusted Relic of Termination's drop rates.

    * Reimplemented survivor-related unlocks. Executioner is intentionally unlocked by default now.
    * SS2 Survivors have item displays for all base and SOTV items. 
    * Added significantly more configs, split into individual files. You can now disable events individually, disable equipments, and items that were lacking in configurable options now have them.

* Items & Equipment
    * Added Insecticide.
    * Reworked Relic of Termination: "Every 30 seconds, gain a buff which marks the next spawning enemy. If defeated in time, they drop an item; if not, they drop nothing and delay the next mark. Marked enemies have significantly increased stats. (Rarity of the dropped item increases with stacks)." Additionally, it has clearer mark VFX.
    * Reworked Needles: "Non-critical strikes add +1% critical chance against the struck enemy. Additional critical chance is cleared after 1 (+1 per stack) critical strikes against them." 
    * Reworked Coffee Bag: "Using interactables increases movement speed by 21% and attack speed by 22.5% for up to 15 (+15 per stack) seconds."
    * Reworked Pressurized Cannister: "Grants an upward boost upon activating, and grants a temporary additional jump until landing."
    * Adjusted Detritive Trematode - The debuff no longer expires, but the low health threshold was lowered to 25% for consistency with other "low health" items.
    * Adjusted Droid Head - Spawned drones are now more aggressive and should be less likely to spawn clipping into the ground.
