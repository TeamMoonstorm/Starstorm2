# Starstorm 2 Nightly

## Overview

Starstorm 2 is a work-in-progress RoR2 port of Starstorm, a diverse gameplay and content mod for Risk of Rain 1. It features two new survivors, over 20 new items and equipment, and a new, dangerous event to shake up your runs.

More information on Starstorm, including features and content to look forward to in SS2, can be found in its info section at https://rainfusion.ml/ or its wiki at https://starstormmod.fandom.com/wiki/Starstorm_Mod_Wiki. For more information on SS2, including development updates and an outlet for feedback and bug reports, visit our Discord server at https://discord.gg/4p6NdERUcZ.

## Nightly?

Nightly builds are unstable versions of Starstorm 2! This release may be buggy, but we're working on fixing those bugs for a stable SOTV release over at https://thunderstore.io/package/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2/.

Note that updates may not truly be Nightly.

## Features

![](https://i.imgur.com/YFiPuTM.png)

* **Executioner** - An aggressive, versatile survivor with an arsenal made for picking off targets and chaining kills. His powerful ion gun gains a shot for every enemy you take down.

* **???** - A survivor of unknown origin, familiar yet unfamiliar. Under the right conditions, you may meet him on the planet, but he certainly won't be on your side.

* **New items** - 20 new items and 5 new equipment to support new and existing playstyles. Speed through teleporter events with the Field Accelerator, become a stationary powerhouse with the Hunter's Sigil, or gain some vertical thrust on demand with the Pressurized Canister!

* **Typhoon** - The planet's ultimate challenge awaits those who dare...

* **Storms** - When the skies cloud over, be on your guard. These occasional bouts of bad weather provide enemies with dangerous stat boosts.

## Changelog

**Warning: content spoilers below!**
### 0.3.38β
* Updated to Survivors of the Void & MSU 1.0.1. 
    * This update has notable balance changes! Please delete your configs. 
	* Was a long time coming, with of course more to come.
* General:
	* Fixed bugs caused by various interactions between new items / survivors. (ex. Molten coin works with ignition tank.)
	* Disabled items that were replaced by SOTV items, those being Coffee Bag, Dormant Fungus, and Erratic Gadget. These items may get reworks some time down the line. 
	* Adjusted some descriptions for items and abilities to be more clear / accurate. 
    * Added configs for more items that previously lacked them.
* Survivors:
	* <b>Nemesis Commando: </b>
	* Reduced damage for Submission, his default special, from 48x60% to 24x70%.
	* Added a new keyword - Rend. Pistol skills have this keyword, which makes them deal more damage to enemies with gouge applied.
	* Readded Ancient Scepter skills.
* Items 
	* <b>Tier 1: </b>
	* Armed Backpack - reworked. Chance to fire a missile on taking damage. 
	* Detritive Trematode - Low health threshold normalized from 40% -> 25%, and increased DoT damage to compensate 
	* Diary - reworked. Gain bonus EXP upon killing a boss enemy. 
	* Fork - Adjusted to be +2 base damage. Ends up being largely the same for most survivors, with only Mul-T getting a slight buff and Acrid getting a slight nerf. Additionally makes the item way less scary when enemies get it.
	* Malice - Only procs from survivor attacks. Damage reduced from 55% -> 35% total damage. Maintains damage through the chain, rather than decaying per jump.
	* Needles - Required procs for full crits reduced from 5 -> 2. 
	* Added X4 Stimulant. (Does this item feel meaningful? Too strong? Feedback is especially welcome)
	* <b>Tier 2: </b>
	* Blood Tester and Hottest Sauce removed. Will likely get reworks.
	* Jet Boots - Replaced stunning in the description with description. It never stunned. 
	* Low Quality Speaker - has a model and new icon.
	* Watch Metronome - Now builds stacks while not moving and not sprinting at the same rate. Slightly reduced maximum build rate to compensate.
	* <b>Tier 3: </b>
	* Baby's Toys - Now actually reduces level by 3, keeping the stats.
	* Nkota's Heritage - Stacking now gives multiple items per level up rather than increasing drooped item rarity. 
	* Portable Reactor - has a model and icon. 
	* Swift Skateboard - Now only plays a sound effect if you don't already have the buff, to prevent sound effect spamming.
	* <b>Lunar: </b>
	* Added Relic of Force. 

* Known Issues
	* Nemmando's boss fight doesn't fully work. 
	* Some item displays are missing.

* General
	* Updated the mod to work with Moonstorm Shared Utils 0.8.0.

### 0.3.33β
* Fixed the mod shipping with debug features enabled.

### 0.3.32β
(*This will hopefully be the last Nightly release before we push an update to the main mod. There might be some undocumented changes. I'm very tired.*)
* Executioner
    * Added new passive: Bloodbath - Killing enemies inflicted with fear reduces all skill cooldowns by 1 second
    * Slightly reworded some skill descriptions and added keywords to hopefully make things clearer and easier to digest
    * Fear now provides a 30% movement speed reduction to enemies when applied

    * Half reimplemented ragoll
    * KNOWN ISSUE: Executioner's ragdoll hangs itself via psychic force

    * Added new Sprint animation
    * Doubled turning radius to be in-line with Vanilla survivors
* Items
    * All: Rewrote many descriptions to match Vanilla wording and phrasing better
    * A Lot: Modified internally to use RecalculateStatsAPI, which means better stat stacking and less bugs.
    * Armed Backpack: Added
    * Back Thruster: Slight rework - now functions like Metroid's Speed Booster when activated, accelerating the user when running in a straight line (*Would this feel better if you could 'run over' enemies for damage? Like a Bighorn Bison?*)
    * Baby Toys: Added, looking for feedback on current implementation
    * Broken Blood Tester: Now uses flat values instead of whatever nonsense was going on before
    * Dormant Fungus: Reduced healing to not heal for 100% of health on proc

    * KNOWN ISSUE: Baby Toys lack model, sprites and formatted tokens
* Artifacts
    * Added code for Cognation, alongside a proper trial.
* Interactables
    * Added the mod's first Interactable: the Escape Pod. These escape pods can be opened up for free, and will open up to reveal items, monsters, or less fortunate survivors. Heavy feedback on them is much appreciated (Are spawn rates too high? chances for goodies too low?)
    * KNOWN ISSUE: Drop Pods dont have proper tokens
* Events
    * Nemesis Invasion: Nemesis survivors are now given inventories when spawning
    * KNOWN ISSUE: Event rates might be messed up still|
* Other
    * Miscellaneous: We've began to add disabled content to a lot of things that should not be included on the next nightly release. this includes Slate Mines
    * Miscellaneous: Added a Starstorm2Content Class, functionality is basically the same as RoR2's RoR2Content class.
    * Unlockables: Rewritten which means all unlocks have been reset, they should work properly now.
    * Unlockables: Added missing unlocks (EG: Single Tap)
    * Language Files: Reformatted internally, let us know if issues arise as a result of this
    * Bugfix: Void cells should now always drop a reward
    * KNOWN ISSUE: MUL-T's Grand Mastery lacks emissions and tokens.

### 0.3.31β
(*I don't think this is appropriate for a full on dev log, but right now current focus is on fixing up content to reach version parity with Stable + push ThunderKit build to there. After that, we'll be looking at future content, including Cyborg and Ethereal Teleporters. For now, feedback is CRUCIAL - this is intended as a 'final test' for a lot of features, and specific things still need to be fixed that are skimmed over just to get this out ASAP. Things generally should be working more than before, but some things are still messed up. Be as critical of anything in the mod that seems off as you can.*)
* General
    * Title screen is now a bit less purple and a bit more Risk of Rain 2
    * KNOWN ISSUE: It's a long standing one, but it's on my to-fix list: MUL-T Grandmastery uses incorrect material.
    * KNOWN ISSUE: Unlocks are broken.
    * KNOWN ISSUE: Hottest Sauce, Jet Boots, and Stirring Soul have missing or broken visual effects.
    * KNOWN ISSUE: When Canticum Vitae ends it doesnt resume the original stage's song.
* Events
    * Significantly lowered intensity of Storm visuals
    * Enemies now receive a unique buff icon while storms are active to help signify that storms buff them
    * Slightly tweaked storm spawn rates, should now be less common. (*How do storm spawn rates feel? Too common? Too rare? Please test on multiple difficulties, and respect that the game is designed to be played on Rainstorm - though feedback for all is crucial.*)
    * Removed regular storms from Sky Meadow in favor of 100% Purple Rain
    * Nemesis Invasion: Removed from Commencement spawn pool (*This was a weird fix that may have broken things. Let me know if you see more than one Nemmando during your run. Also, the Void Event is being dropped entirely until we get a better look at the DLC. Until then, I may try to merge the old visuals into this if there's interest.*)
* Executioner
    * Fear: Updated buff icon
    * Crowd Dispersion: Lowered speed multiplier from 3.0 to 2.0, as it was pre-ThunderKit - this should make it more controllable
    * Supercharged: Updated buff icon
* Nemesis Commando
    * Fixed materials of all skins to match pre-ThunderKit
    * Gouge: Now refreshes duration of existing stacks when applied, again
    * Distant Gash: Now properly applies gouge
    * Added IDRS for all the Vanilla Items & Equipments.
    * (This just leaves his animator as an outlying issue.)*
* Items
(Developer Note: *You should probably delete your old config.*)
    * Detritive Trematode: Changed stacking behavior to directly increase damage rather than increase debuff duration
    * Detritive Trematode: Buffed movement speed reduction (10% -> 20%)
    * Dormant Fungus: Fixed scaling being 1/100th as good as it should've been. Oops
    * Dormant Fungus: Increased duration between procs from 0.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds 
    * Dormant Fungus: Rebalance healing amounts (2% + 0.5% per stack -> 1% + 1% per stack) (*This was done as per suggestion of Moffein, as most Common items tend to scale linearally like this. This item is currently a candidate for a slight rework with the announcement of Weeping Fungus. Stay tuned.*)
    * Fork: Changed behavior to Starstorm 1's. The days of overpowered fork are no more! (+7% TOTAL damage -> +25% BASE damage, without levelups *This is probably a sad change but I think it's for the best.*)
    * Green Chocolate: Updated buff icon
    * Greater Warbanner: (*Would people prefer this item if you could place more than one at a time, but they disappeared after a duration? Or is it fine it is?*) 
    * Hunter's Sigil: Updated buff icon
    * Malice: Temporarily disabled (*Previous version of this item was breaking the game. Will have finished for final release.*)
    * Needles: Updated long description for clarity on how the item works post-rework
    * Needles: Changed stacking behaviors to increase duration of the 'pricked' debuff preceeding the 'needles' debuff
    * Watch Metronome: Updated buff icon
    * KNOWN ISSUE: I don't think Pressurized Cannister or Back Thruster are networked. 
* Artifacts
    * Added Artifact of Cognation.
