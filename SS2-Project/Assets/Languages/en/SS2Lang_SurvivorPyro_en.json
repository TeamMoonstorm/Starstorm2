		"SS2_PYRO_LORE": "Buzzing, buzzing, and more buzzing. As they tried to go over the final details of the job, the droning of insect wings was the only sound to break through - but it didn’t matter. The job was simple, and he knew how to see it through properly. The woman in the hardhat proceeded back to the port as the man in polymeric fibers equipped a sizable weapon from his back. Clutching it firmly in one hand, he used the other to manage the cargo bay doors, bracing himself for the swarm within.\n\nA suffocating miasma of acid filled the air as the doors slid open. If not for his respirator, the fumes would’ve been unbearable, toxic enough to knock him out within minutes. The thick air was populated with countless giant green bugs, busily flying between corroded containers and the hive structures they’d built between them. Their incessant droning drowned out his thoughts - just the way he liked it. None of the insects took notice of the intruder until a torrent of napalm exploded into a blaze. \n\nWarriors descended as workers scattered, though it was too late for all of them. The ones quick enough to form an offense merely hastened their demise, falling to his feet as the fire devoured them. Napalm clung indiscriminately to nest, pest, and security chest alike as he slowly weaved his way between the labyrinth of cargo that laid out the foundations of the lair. Black smoke began to fill the bay, thickening with each step he took, while the ground piled high with charred remains. More than anything, though, it was the heat - the relentless, searing heat of his cleaning flames - that filled the room. Shipping containers turned into furnaces, and the bay a graveyard as he systematically purged the infestation.\n\nHours later, little was left but the acrid stench of decay, the occasional mandible or thorax, and a fine layer of ash carpeting the floor. After a third lap around the bay, he finally found what he’d been searching for, stashed away behind cracked container doors in the darkest corner of the room: an unharmed nest of eggs. He chuckled to himself, closing the cracked door and submerging the eggs back into darkness. As the large bay doors slammed shut, the woman in the helmet wrinkled her nose, handing him payment for a job well done. And a job well done it was - one hundred percent of the live bugs reduced to an easy clean-up.\n\nAs he left the dock, he thought about the bonus he’d claimed for himself: the eggs, healthily growing in their ideal conditions, where regulation couldn’t look until it was too late. There would never be a job as enjoyable as them.",
