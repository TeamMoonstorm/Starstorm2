Bullets loaded, ion manipulators charged.\n\n<color=#CCD3E0> < ! > Use Service Pistol to score kills to charge your Ion Manipulators - or charge them manually during downtime.\n\n< ! > Ion Burst is at its strongest when used at maximum charge. Spread its shots across a crowd to maximize its shocking effect.\n\n< ! > Execution is a great crowd control AND single target tool. Don't forget that its damage depends on how many targets it hits!\n\n< ! > Use Crowd Dispersion to manipulate enemies and set them up for a well-placed Execution.",

    "SS2_EXECUTIONER2_LORE": "Death is inevitable. It comes for us all. Some may try to evade it, or run from it. But death arrives all the same. Death, however, is simply the cost of war. And death in glorious combat is one of the best deaths a man could ask for.\n\nBut, as always, some would seek to run from death. We call them by many names. Deserters, cowards, turncoats. Each and every one of them, traitors to the cause. These traitors must be punished for their crime. And that punishment: in an ironic twist, is the very thing they tried to avoid.\n\nDeath will come for them. Not as a robed spectre with a scythe. Not in a trench coat, holding a revolver. Not as a sickness, nor the wear of time. No. For them, death will come bearing lustrous battlegarb, with service pistol loaded, and ion manipulators fully charged.",
