Try to maximize airtime to stay safe and dodge attacks.\n\n< ! > Soothing Venom both heals allies and damages enemies in a radius. Try to position your friend- or yourself- near groups of enemies to maximize the effect.\n\n< ! > Abduct is an incredibly versatile skill that can be used to buff your allies, fly to safety, group targets together, or lock down a tough enemy.\n\n< ! > Symbiotic Link allows you to befriend an enemy under 50% health, giving it a copy of your inventory. Your friend constantly loses health over time, so it is vital to support them with your other abilities.</color>",

\u201C...As the sons grew old, so did their mother. Soon came time for her to depart - but before she did, she left two gifts. One for her sons, and one for the world.\n\n

For the sons she was leaving, she gave the gift of ambition and compassion. Together, they would achieve anything they could imagine. They would make paradise. For the world she was leaving, she created life. The world's first true natives. They would be the world's caretakers, and together, its very essence...\u201C\n\n
