That militant group on Pluto had stolen a bunch of those ER-14s, and had been using 'em at their bases for a while. This one specifically, ER-14XPC5VVUFF, lines up with the ones you'd tried to recall a while back. I don't know this history, I just know there was a big bounty for whoever could find the remains for this batch. There's other remnants, too, but they're much less complete...

I have gathered you all here today to share some important news.\n\nFirst, it pains my heart to announce that Nkota, the last of our great leaders, our kind matriarch, has sadly passed on from this life. As far as we know, she took her last breath peacefully in rest last night, full of years and with all business here finished. With that said, there shall be no one to succeed her in leadership. She was the last of her line, with no living brothers, sisters, or children.\n\nInstead, in her final testament, her wisdom has created a new beginning. For us. For all of us. Her wish is that the remaining members of this community spread out, either together or separately, into the world. It is perhaps a drastic option, but one that I, personally, also believe to be the best for this community.\n\nNkota shall be buried at our final destination, as is her will. You all may grieve for her and this community for a time, but do not tarry. A group of pilgrims will travel with myself to the great grey path, fifty miles west, after a week's time. You may follow, or go on your own way. It is your choice entirely. If you do not think that you can make the journey, do not fret. Nkota may have had no children, yes, but her heritage is in spirit, not in blood. You are all her children, and she will protect you until you reach your final goal.\n\nThank you all for your time. I would suggest you begin to pack your possessions for the journey ahead.\"\n\n - Eulogy for Nkota and the Village of Dago",

Shock. Satisfaction. Excitement. A third voice, calling out impatiently over the Venusian storm.\n\n\"Come in, boys- dinner's ready and it's no weather to be skateboarding in!\"",
