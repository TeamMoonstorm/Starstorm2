Furthen, naturalist aboard the UES [Redacted] in conjunction with the ongoing UES Research and Documentation of Outer Life program. This entry was written at Point Sigma, during an expedition to the dense jungles of Cornea III.\n\n---------------------\n\nI have encountered my first sample of outer life on this planet! What a marvel it is, too. The sample resembles an earthen roundworm, but significantly bigger. I have assigned their common name as 'Detritive Trematode', and will describe their properties below.\n\n• Roughly two inches in diameter, and varying in size from about four inches to a foot and a half in length. White coloration.\n\n• These trematodes were found feasting on a pile of rotting meat in a damp cavern. The meat was of indeterminate origin, but the presence of other, larger animals is exciting nonetheless.\n\n• Upon scooping up a clump of the rotting meat, the trematodes quickly reacted to the movement and began wriggling around, before slowly relaxing. The guard positioned with me, Chevry, I think, was disgusted.\n\n• Upon touching one with an ungloved hand to feel their texture, one of the trematodes latched onto my palm and began chewing. It was extremely painful, both to have the trematode on my hand, and when Chevry cut the thing off. Despite that, other than a light gash on my palm, I believe I am fine.\n",

There's a couple dozen different people who wrote in this diary, writing down their fond memories, odd mysteries, riddles, their answers to those riddles, all sorts of things.\"\n\"Huh. This thing must be a real treasure trove of knowledge then, yeah? Any clue as to who last owned it?\"\n\"Uh, yeah, actually.

Our clothes, doors, and even some machinery. We will continue to monitor this behavior.\n\n<style=cMono>Specimen-18305 Week 5 Notes</style>\n\nThe subject has continued to attach itself to things around the lab. We've noted that it becomes healthier the more it moves with its attached object. Tests seem to indicate it subsists off of the heat created by movements, taken in by its roots. We will attempt to transplant it to a consistently moving machine and monitor its health.\n\n<style=cMono>Specimen-18305 Week 8 Notes</style>\n\nWe've left the sample attached to an old model of piston from the lab. In case of any damage, we had intended to dispose of it regardless. We had attached it and left it running the previous 3 weeks. Most curiously, the piston was assumed to break down in this time frame. However, it would seem the subject has created a symbiotic relationship with the machine. We will continue to monitor this behavior for more negative effects, and potential other uses for this specimen.\n",

Concerned that someone might have tried to ship a living animal under Standard protocol, he felt the need to investigate. Instead, what was in the chest was a small plastic package containing a large number of particularly sizable sewing needles, obviously packaged far too tightly for any amount of safety.\n\nFinally, and, likely in a lapse of judgement, Will decided to touch the package. This caused the package to suddenly rupture into his general direction, leaving his upper front side covered in deep gashes. He's lucky someone found him quickly. He seems to be doing fine, but will be recovering from the shock and loss of blood for a while.\"\n\nEnd of report.",
