This entry was written at Point Sigma, during an expedition to the dense jungles of Cornea III.\n\n---------------------\n\nI have encountered my first sample of outer life on this planet! What a marvel it is, too. The sample resembles an earthen roundworm, but significantly bigger. I have assigned their common name as 'Detritive Trematode', and will describe their properties below.\n\n• Roughly two inches in diameter, and varying in size from about four inches to a foot and a half in length. White coloration.\n\n• These trematodes were found feasting on a pile of rotting meat in a damp cavern. The meat was of indeterminate origin, but the presence of other, larger animals is exciting nonetheless.\n\n• Upon scooping up a clump of the rotting meat, the trematodes quickly reacted to the movement and began wriggling around, before slowly relaxing. The guard positioned with me, Chevry, I think, was disgusted.\n\n• Upon touching one with an ungloved hand to feel their texture, one of the trematodes latched onto my palm and began chewing. It was extremely painful, both to have the trematode on my hand, and when Chevry cut the thing off. Despite that, other than a light gash on my palm, I believe I am fine.\n",

Concerned that someone might have tried to ship a living animal under Standard protocol, he felt the need to investigate. Instead, what was in the chest was a small plastic package containing a large number of particularly sizable sewing needles, obviously packaged far too tightly for any amount of safety.\n\nFinally, and, likely in a lapse of judgement, Will decided to touch the package. This caused the package to suddenly rupture into his general direction, leaving his upper front side covered in deep gashes. He's lucky someone found him quickly.
