    "SS2_NEMESIS_MERCENARY_DESCRIPTION": "The Nemesis Mercenary is a fast-paced, short-range survivor, with the tools to dominate any combat encounter - no matter the odds. \n\n<color=#CCD3E0>< ! > Splatter deals devastating damage at close range. Use your other skills to close the distance.\n\n< ! > Use Cutthroat to interrupt attacks, or to redirect your dash towards more enemies.\n\n< ! > Dispatch is a powerful mobility option in combat, and doesn't interrupt your reload.\n\n< ! > Attack Vectors can be blinked to with no cooldown. This makes Exploit a key skill in navigating intense situations.",
    "SS2_NEMESIS_MERCENARY_OUTRO_FLAVOR": "..and so he left, with newfound purpose in every shell.",
    "SS2_NEMESIS_MERCENARY_OUTRO_FAILURE": "..and so he vanished, with emptied munitions and an emptier heart.",
    "SS2_NEMESIS_MERCENARY_LORE": "\u201CHey!\u201C\n\n
A figure slowly hobbled out from the sandy Martian dunes, tuning into Fort Laughn's external communications. \u201CHey, mind letting me in? Dust out here is killing me.\u201C\n\n
 
One of the stationed guards on the outer fence quipped back from a booth. \u201C...You got credentials, sir?\u201C\n\n

\u201CCome on, you don't recognize me? Let me guess- new recruit? Something like that?\u201C The figure continued walking nonchalantly toward the fence as a second guard piped up. \u201CHold on. Is that Vantre?\u201C The guest laughed, still wandering every-which-way as he came closer to the fence. \u201CGuilty as charged. Thought I'd stop by while I'm in the area. Say hey to some old comrades, maybe.\u201C\n\n

The guards paused, then, on a separate line, rang up their CO. \u201CCommanding Officer Byren, Vantre's at the outer fence. He appears non-threatening, which is an immediate red flag. What're your orders?\u201C\n\n

Byren's scratchy, exasperated voice chirped back through the receiver. \u201CUgh, damnit… Page the suppression crew. Make sure he's not trying anything, alright? Keep him busy until you've got more people out there.\u201C The guard relayed the order- \u201CGet a crew out here. I'll make sure Vantre doesn't try anything stupid.\u201C The recruit replied with a question: \u201CSure, but, uhh… Where'd he go?\u201C\n\n

Sure enough, Vantre had vanished while the two were distracted, leaving nothing but sparks in the air where he once stood. It took the entirety of the fort's stationed force about ten minutes to figure out what was going on- and they found out at about the same time they found their commanding officer dead in his quarters, the back of his head blasted to smithereens.
