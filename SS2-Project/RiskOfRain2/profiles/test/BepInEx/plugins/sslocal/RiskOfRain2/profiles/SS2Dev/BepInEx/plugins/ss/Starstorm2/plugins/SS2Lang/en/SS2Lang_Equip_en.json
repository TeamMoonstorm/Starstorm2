Calbury Ln, Adora, Mercury\nShipping Details:\n\nI was finally able to get ahold of a personal cloaking device for you. Sneaking around in places you shouldn't be should be a cinch with this puppy.\n\nNow, there's a couple a' things you should understand about this thing. First, the cloaking only lasts a short time since the device is so small, so keep yourself hidden while it cools down again. Secondly, you need to hit the button on the headband to activate it. Not exactly a very clandestine action, I know, but it's what I could find for you.\n\nLast, if the box you get seems like it's completely empty, just feel around in the bottom until you find the button. It saves time, money, and privacy to ship it without the Volatile treatment. tell me when this gets to you, and have fun with your new toy.\n",

		"SS2_EQUIP_GREATERWARBANNER_LORE": "<style=cMono>Recording from the Terran Museum of Tactics and Warfare.</style>\n\nSome say that one of the most important resources on the battlefield is morale. The functionality of a unit is exponentially increased depending on the mood of the troops within it. This can be raised or lowered through various means. For example, the quality of their lodging or food, news they've heard from their home, or even spending time recreationally.\n\nHowever, one tried and true method of raising the morale of a unit is the usage of symbolism. Many armies would wear colors and designs symbolizing their beliefs and their strength. Many units would carry flags in order to keep their morale high in combat.\n\nThe usage of this method has also seen variations. While a flag bearer for a unit will increase morale, it has been observed that flags unique to higher ranking military will further increase the unit's morale. Should a Colonel or General's flag appear on the battlefield, the troops will be encouraged by the power they display, and in turn increase their own fighting prowess.\n",
