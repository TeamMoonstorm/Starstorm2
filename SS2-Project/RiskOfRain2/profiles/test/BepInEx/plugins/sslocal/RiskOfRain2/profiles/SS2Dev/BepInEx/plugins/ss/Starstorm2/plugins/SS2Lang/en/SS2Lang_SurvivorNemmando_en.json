    "SS2_NEMMANDO_LORE": "He lays to rest by a fire, setting the weapons he carries within an arm's reach. Checking his surroundings, hoping the cave he hid in would be enough shelter. Some would say, it isn't wise to be overly cautious. He would say, <color=#FFCCED>they haven't seen enough.</color>\n\nThe service pistol he got when he enlisted. Well used, dirtied, and loved. It's brought him through thick and thin, no matter which mission he took on. Some would say, only a fool would trust their weapon. He would say, <color=#FFCCED>your weapon is all you can trust.</color>\n\nThe blade of a fallen brother of war. Picked from what he could scavenge of the last of humanity he's seen. Some would say, it keeps their spirits united. He would say, <color=#FFCCED>it's to keep their spirits from joining for as long as possible.</color>\n\nThe loads of cargo that landed with him. Each item picked from a chest, keeping him alive in one way or another. Dozens of shipments to anyone but him. Some would say, they aren't his items to take. He would say, <color=#FFCCED>if he doesn't take them, then no one will.</color>\n\nThe glow of a violet light coming from deeper within the cave. Calming, warming... beckoning. Welcoming him deeper and deeper, promising safety. Some would say, what sounds too good to be true probably is. He would say, <color=#FFCCED>Faust was a wise man.</color>",
