And death in glorious combat is one of the best deaths a man could ask for.\n\nBut, as always, some would seek to run from death. We call them by many names. Deserters, cowards, turncoats. Each and every one of them, traitors to the cause. These traitors must be punished for their crime. And that punishment: in an ironic twist, is the very thing they tried to avoid.\n\nDeath will come for them. Not as a robed spectre with a scythe. Not in a trench coat, holding a revolver. Not as a sickness, nor the wear of time. No. For them, death will come bearing lustrous battlegarb, with service pistol loaded, and ion manipulators fully charged.",
