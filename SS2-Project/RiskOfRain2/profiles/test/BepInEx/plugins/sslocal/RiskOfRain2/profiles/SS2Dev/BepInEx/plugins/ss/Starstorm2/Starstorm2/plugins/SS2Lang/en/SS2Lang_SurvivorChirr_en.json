Will, do you copy?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah, what's up?\"\n\n\"Against all odds, I found something that only didn't immediately try to kill me, but actually seems genuinely friendly.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah? That's impressive. What is it?\"\n\n\"It's, uh, a bug? Maybe? I'm not sure. It definitely looks like some sort of giant mantis, but-\"\n\n\"Hold on, hold on. You said giant mantis? How big was it, you think?\"\n\n\"Uh, hang on, gimme a minute...\"\n\n\"...About, say, 10 feet long? And about 6 or so feet tall.\"\n\n\"That's... pretty big. You sure that thing is friendly?\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely. I ran into them while running away from a swarm of those wasps, and the moment I passed by it started gettin' real aggressive towards them. Spraying needles at them, headbutting the ones on the ground, and it just kept going at 'em until they flew away. Territorial? Probably, but it kinda looked like the wasps hated that thing as much as it feels they hate me.\"\n\n\"Huh. Well, I guess if it's keeping you safe, then by all means continue as you were.\"\n\n\"Alright, then. I'll keep you poste- Hmm? Something wrong, Chirr?\"\n\n\"H- Hold on. Who's Chirr?\"\n\n\"That's her name. The mantis, or whatever.\"\n\n\"...Hang on.\"",
